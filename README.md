# RecipEat
RecipEat is a recipe recommender web application that uses a multi-label image classification model to recommend french recipes from an image of multiple ingredients. 
Using Keras with TensorFlow backend, the model is pre-trained with ImageNet and the fully-connected layers are re-trained with an image dataset of thirty of the most common ingredients found in the french cuisine. The web app itself is built with a Flask framework and styled with Pure CSS. 
For future improvements, RecipEat can recognize more ingredients and suggest recipes from other cuisines.
